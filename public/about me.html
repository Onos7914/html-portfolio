<p> 
        Hi, glad to have you here buddy, 
  My name is joseph destiny, i'm a student of the federal polytechnic in Auchi, Edo state. 
  I am a bonafied computer science student with an ND degree (which was completed last year), 
  currently i'm running my iT (online) with Angela yu on the Udemy app 
  and its been so much of an amazing exerience i must say, 
  i've grown from been a total novice to becoming familiar with the basic web designing tools 
  and currently learning how to use the html for web designing as well. 
  i'll love to be a pro in my field at all cost, 
  because i strongly believe there's a space for me in ythe tech world.</p> 

  <p>Thanks</p>
